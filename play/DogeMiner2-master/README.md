# Doge Miner v2.9

To play, use something like `http-server` using node.js to host the files, then go to the index.html file in the /play/ folder. Voila.

# DISCLAIMER

I did NOT make Dogeminer 2 (or Dogeminer 1). I am just a fan who had nothing to do one day and ~~stole~~ ripped the files. Join their discord at https://dogeminer2.com/discord.
